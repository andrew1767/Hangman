<div class="hangman-description">
    <p>Welcome to Hangman! Choose a topic and the computer will think of a word based on the chosen topic. 
        You'll try to guess what the word is one guess at a time. The secret word will initially be a number 
        of dashes representing the length of the secret word. Guessing a correct letter using the on-screen keyboard
        will replace one or more of the dashes with the guessed letter. However, guessing an incorrect letter will make you one body part
        closer to losing the game and letting the man be executed. Good luck and HAVE FUN!
